  "Specialized meaninglessness has come to be regarded, in certain circles, as a kind of hallmark of true science.\n -- Aldous Huxley\n",

  "Happiness can exist only in acceptance.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Political language... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don't even know that fire is hot.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence. In other words, it is war minus the shooting.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Society has always to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "War is a way of shattering to pieces... materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and... too intelligent.\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns, as it were, instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it; consequently, the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash but constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feeling whatever.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "There is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no difference who wins. Nearly always one side stands more or less for progress, the other side more or less for reaction.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others.\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "I'm fat, but I'm thin inside... there's a thin man inside every fat man.\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "If you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics - a creed from which you yourself cannot expect to draw any material advantage - surely that proves that you are in the right?\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "Progress is not an illusion, it happens, but it is slow and invariably disappointing.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun.\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "Advertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "One can love a child, perhaps, more deeply than one can love another adult, but it is rash to assume that the child feels any love in return.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Part of the reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child's eyes, is that the child is usually looking upwards, and few faces are at their best when seen from below.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "No advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Most people get a fair amount of fun out of their lives, but on balance life is suffering, and only the very young or the very foolish imagine otherwise.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Good writing is like a windowpane.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Many people genuinely do not want to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "A family with the wrong members in control; that, perhaps, is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "The intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in certain sections of his personality, and even then not all the time.\n -- George Orwell\n",

  "Joyce is a poet and also an elephantine pedant.\n -- George Orwell\n",
  "Strange how paranoia can link up with reality now and then.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words. If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "We live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups. I ask, in my writing, 'What is real?' Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo realities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "The trouble with being educated is that it takes a long time; it uses up the better part of your life and when you are finished what you know is that you would have benefited more by going into banking.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "Don't try to solve serious matters in the middle of the night.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "The Martians are always coming.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "I dreamed: I am the fish whose flesh is eaten, and because I am fat, it is good.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "I want to write about people I love, and put them into a fictional world spun out of my own mind, not the world we actually have, because the world we actually have does not meet my standards.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "This, to me, is the ultimately heroic trait of ordinary people; they say no to the tyrant and they calmly take the consequences of this resistance.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "Science fiction writers, I am sorry to say, really do not know anything. We can't talk about science, because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial, and usually our fiction is dreadful.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "The core of my writing is not art but truth.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "I am one of the elect, one of the few in the know, in the gnosis.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "When I believe, I am crazy. When I don't believe, I suffer psychotic depression.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "I am a fictionalizing philosopher, not a novelist.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "The universe is information and we are stationary in it, not three dimensional and not in space or time.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "I am basically analytical, not creative; my writing is simply a creative way of handling analysis.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "Drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision to step out in front of a moving car. You would call that not a disease but an error of judgment.\n -- Philip K. Dick\n",
  "The pen is mightier than the sword if the sword is very short, and the pen is very sharp.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I became a journalist at 17. A few hours later, I saw my first dead body, which was somewhat... colourful. That's when I learned you can go on throwing up after you run out of things to throw up.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The harder I work, the luckier I become.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "It occurred to me that at one point it was like I had two diseases - one was Alzheimer's, and the other was knowing I had Alzheimer's.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it's not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The ideal death, I think, is what was the ideal Victorian death, you know, with your grandchildren around you, a bit of sobbing. And you say goodbye to your loved ones, making certain that one of them has been left behind to look after the shop.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I believe everyone should have a good death. You know, with your grandchildren around you, a bit of sobbing. Because after all, tears are appropriate on a death bed. And you say goodbye to your loved ones, making certain that one of them has been left behind to look after the shop.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "You can't build a plot out of jokes. You need tragic relief. And you need to let people know that when a lot of frightened people are running around with edged weaponry, there are deaths. Stupid deaths, usually. I'm not writing 'The A-Team' - if there's a fight going on, people will get hurt. Not letting this happen would be a betrayal.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Five exclamation marks, the sure sign of an insane mind.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Writing is the most fun you can have by yourself.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Opera happens because a large number of things amazingly fail to go wrong.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I'll be more enthusiastic about encouraging thinking outside the box when there's evidence of any thinking going on inside it.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The truth may be out there, but lies are inside your head.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Sometimes it is better to light a flamethrower than curse the darkness.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "It's not worth doing something unless you were doing something that someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "It seems that when you have cancer you are a brave battler against the disease, but when you have Alzheimer's you are an old fart. That's how people see you. It makes you feel quite alone.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I must have read every issue of 'Punch' published in the 20th century, and I think in the process I picked up the true voice of English humour - that amiable, fairly liberal, laconic voice which you find in something like 'Three Men in a Boat.'\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "My advice is this. For Christ's sake, don't write a book that is suitable for a kid of 12 years old, because the kids who read who are 12 years old are reading books for adults. I read all of the James Bond books when I was about 11, which was approximately the right time to read James Bond books.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I think when people mean that Discworld books have become darker they really mean the series is growing up. In 'The Colour of Magic' most of the city is set alight. It's a joke, in much the same way that the Earth is destroyed almost at the start of Douglas Adams's 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.'\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "It cannot be said often enough that science fiction as a genre is incredibly educational - and I'm speaking the written science fiction, not 'Star Trek.' Science fiction writers tend to fill their books if they're clever with little bits of interesting stuff and real stuff.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Fantasy is uni-age. You can start it in the creche, and it follows you to death.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "In all seriousness, people think that it's the ideas that are important. Well, everyone has ideas, all the time. I tend to write mine down and remember them, but at some point you have to apply the bum to the seat and knock out about sixty five thousand words - that's how long a novel is.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I've got wide tastes, but I don't like jazz.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The 'New Testament', now, I quite liked. Jesus had a lot of good things to say, and as for his father, he must have been highly thought of by the community to work with wood - a material that couldn't have been widely available in Palestine.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Freedom without limits is just a word.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Most gods throw dice, but Fate plays chess, and you don't find out til too late that he's been playing with two queens all along.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character; there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The most watched programme on the BBC, after the news, is probably 'Doctor Who.' What has happened is that science fiction has been subsumed into modern literature. There are grandparents out there who speak Klingon, who are quite capable of holding down a job. No one would think twice now about a parallel universe.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "It's not morbid to talk about death. Most people don't worry about death, they worry about a bad death.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "We have been so successful in the past century at the art of living longer and staying alive that we have forgotten how to die. Too often we learn the hard way. As soon as the baby boomers pass pensionable age, their lesson will be harsher still.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Build a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "He was the sort of person who stood on mountaintops during thunderstorms in wet copper armour shouting 'All the Gods are bastards.'\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "You can't trample infidels when you're a tortoise. I mean, all you could do is give them a meaningful look.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Fantasy is an exercise bicycle for the mind. It might not take you anywhere, but it tones up the muscles that can. Of course, I could be wrong.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I think perhaps the most important problem is that we are trying to understand the fundamental workings of the universe via a language devised for telling one another when the best fruit is.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Personally, I think the best motto for an educational establishment is: 'Or Would You Rather Be a Mule?'\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "This isn't life in the fast lane, it's life in the oncoming traffic.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Never trust any complicated cocktail that remains perfectly clear until the last ingredient goes in, and then immediately clouds.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I didn't go to university. Didn't even finish A-levels. But I have sympathy for those who did.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Over the centuries, mankind has tried many ways of combating the forces of evil... prayer, fasting, good works and so on. Up until Doom, no one seemed to have thought about the double-barrel shotgun. Eat leaden death, demon.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Eight years involved with the nuclear industry have taught me that when nothing can possible go wrong and every avenue has been covered, then is the time to buy a house on the next continent.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "It is often said that before you die your life passes before your eyes. It is in fact true. It's called living.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The baby boomers are getting older, and will stay older for longer. And they will run right into the dementia firing range. How will a society cope? Especially a society that can't so readily rely on those stable family relationships that traditionally provided the backbone of care?\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "You can't die with an unfinished book.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I'm a fantasy writer, called a fantasy writer. But there's very little, apart from one or two basic concepts in 'I Shall Wear Midnight,' which are in fact fantasy. You have sticks that fly, but they're practical broomsticks, with a bloody great strap that you can hold on to so you don't fall off. And you try not to use them too often.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "An author writes a book, and that's the book at that point. And if the author writes the book again, then somehow something has gone wrong, if you see what I mean.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I can no longer type, so I use TalkingPoint and Dragon Dictate. It's a speech-to-text program, and there's an add-on for talking which some guys came up with.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Anger is wonderful. It keeps you going. I'm angry about bankers. About the government.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I'm not really good at fun-to-know, human interest stuff. We're not 'celebrities', whose life itself is a performance. Good or bad or ugly, we are our words. They're what people meet.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I do not, in fact, use many puns. Certainly there are far fewer than people believe. But I suspect the ones I do occasionally use tend to hang around in people's memories for a while.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I think I work much harder on the children's books. I suppose I enjoy that. I find it interesting that although there are more than 30 books in the Discworld series, it is the four that were written for children which have won the awards. I've never been quite certain why this is.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "If you are going to write, say, fantasy - stop reading fantasy. You've already read too much. Read other things; read westerns, read history, read anything that seems interesting, because if you only read fantasy and then you start to write fantasy, all you're going to do is recycle the same old stuff and move it around a bit.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Truthfully, without over-egging it, as I often do, the library and journalism, those things made me who I am.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "There are some people who hate my guts. But that goes with the territory.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Seven hundred thousand people who have dementia in this country are not heard. I'm fortunate; I can be heard. Regrettably, it's amazing how people listen if you stand up in public and give away $1 million for research into the disease, as I have done.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Plot exposition that can be gently wound out by the authorial voice and internal monologue of a character in the length of a page has to be delivered in a matter of seconds on the stage.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "There is a rumour going around that I have found God. I think this is unlikely because I have enough difficulty finding my keys, and there is empirical evidence that they exist.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Evolution was far more thrilling to me than the biblical account. Who would not rather be a rising ape than a falling angel? To my juvenile eyes, Darwin was proved true every day. It doesn't take much to make us flip back into monkeys again.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I got quite annoyed after the Haiti earthquake. A baby was taken from the wreckage and people said it was a miracle. It would have been a miracle had God stopped the earthquake. More wonderful was that a load of evolved monkeys got together to save the life of a child that wasn't theirs.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Only in our dreams are we free. The rest of the time we need wages.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "My experience in Amsterdam is that cyclists ride where the hell they like and aim in a state of rage at all pedestrians while ringing their bell loudly, the concept of avoiding people being foreign to them.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I have to write because if I don't get something down then after a while I feel it's going to bang the side of my head off.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The thing is, 'Discworld' had been going on for a very long time, and I've written children's books as well. Usually when people have a really big series they franchise it, which I thought is a bit of a no-no, so I thought what I'd do is I'd franchise it to myself.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I grow as many of our vegetables as I can, because my granddad was a professional gardener, and it's in the blood.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "There was once a caustic comment from someone suggesting I was breeding a new race. Fans from different countries have married, amazing things like that. I've been to some of the weddings. I went to one here the other day, a pagan ceremony.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I write books back to back, and I work very hard on them.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "I don't really plan. I'm almost intuitive about things.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "I intend, before the endgame looms, to die sitting in a chair in my own garden with a glass of brandy in my hand and Thomas Tallis on the iPod. Oh, and since this is England, I had better add, 'If wet, in the library.' Who could say that this is bad?\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "The bravest person I've ever met was a young boy going through massive amounts of treatment for a very rare, complex and unpleasant disease. I last saw him at a Discworld convention, where he chose to take part in a game as an assassin. He died not long afterwards, and I wish I had his fortitude and sense of style.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I think it does Discworld good if I don't write about it all the time: sometimes you have to get it out of your system.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "I like being a writer.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Knowing that you are going to die is, I suspect, the beginning of wisdom.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "I think we are waiting for an e-book that even non-techies can be comfortable with. From my point of view, the biggest change is that I don't have to spend most of the day printing out and packaging a manuscript. I think I almost miss that.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "You have to have really wide reading habits and pay attention to the news and just everything that's going on in the world: you need to. If you get this right, then the writing is a piece of cake.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "When I was a kid, I read the science-fiction shelves, and I read the fantasy shelves.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "There is a soak-the-rich attitude in the air, a feeling that if you have a lot of money you must have got it by some ghastly means. I can quite happily say there was never any family money. All the money we got was mine, just from writing books.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "'Nation' was one that I'd have killed myself if I hadn't written it. It was absolutely important to me that I wrote it. It was good for my soul.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "Christ managed to boil down an awful lot of commandments to a few very simple rules for living.

  "I mean, I wouldn't pay more than a couple of quid to see me, and I'm me.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I am certain no one sets out to be cruel, but our treatment of the elderly ill seems to have no philosophy to it. As a society, we should establish whether we have a policy of life at any cost.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I've always felt that what I have going for me is not my imagination, because everyone has an imagination. What I have is a relentlessly controlled imagination. What looks like wild invention is actually quite carefully calculated.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I particularly admire are Mark Twain and Jerome K. Jerome who wrote in a certain tone of voice which was humane and understanding of humanity, but always ready to annotate its little foibles. I think I'd lay my cards down on that, and say that it's that that I'm trying to do.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "When you read, I'm sure you don't realize that your eyes are going backwards and forwards and to this place and that place. Mine don't do that.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "I don't believe in the war god of the Israelites. He's a bogeyman. Jesus preached the golden rule, by and large.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I think the best thing I ever did with my life was stand up and say I've got Alzheimer's.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I read the 'Old Testament' all the way through when I was about 13 and was horrified. A few months afterwards I read 'The Origin Of Species', hallucinating very mildly because I was in bed with flu at the time. Despite that, or because of that, it all made perfect sense.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Go on, prove me wrong. Destroy the fabric of the universe. See if I care.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I have, before now, waited for a pen to perform a macro.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Mind you, the Elizabethans had so many words for the female genitals that it is quite hard to speak a sentence of modern English without inadvertently mentioning at least three of them.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I think I would like to go into modelling. Of course, I don't know how to do it, and wouldn't be any good at it if I did, so I'm going to employ someone to walk the catwalks on my behalf. It would still be me, of course.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Dickens, as you know, never got round to starting his home page.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "You can't remember the plot of the Dr Who movie because it didn't have one, just a lot of plot holes strung together. It did have a lot of flashing lights, though.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Sooner or later we're all someone's dog.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I regarded finding I had a form of Alzheimer's as an insult and decided to do my best to marshal any kind of forces I could against this wretched disease. I have posterior cortical atrophy or PCA. They say, rather ingenuously, that if you have Alzheimer's it's the best form of Alzheimer's to have.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "It seems sensible to me that we should look to the medical profession, that over the centuries has helped us to live longer and healthier lives, to help us die peacefully among our loved ones in our own home without a long stay in God's waiting room.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I've lost both parents in the last two years, so you pick up on that stuff. That's the most terrible thing about being an author - standing there at your mother's funeral, but you don't switch the author off. So your own innermost thoughts are grist for the mill.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "No one's policing their own minds more than an author. You spend a lot of time in your own head analysing what you think about things, and a philosophy comes.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "If the government ever imposes a tax on books - and I wouldn't put it past them - I'm in dead trouble.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "For an author, the nice characters aren't much fun. What you want are the screwed up characters. You know, the characters that are constantly wondering if what they are doing is the right thing, characters that are not only screwed up but are self-tapping screws. They're doing it for themselves.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "That's the most terrible thing about being an author - standing there at your mother's funeral, but you don't switch the author off. So your own innermost thoughts are grist for the mill. Who was it said - one of the famous lady novelists - 'unhappy is the family that contains an author'?\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "Nothing I can say or devise, and nothing anybody else can say or devise, is going to be perfect.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "Tolkien is eminently filmable, I think. 'The Lord of the Rings' is intensely... landscaped. But 'Discworld' is about dialogue, which is one reason why it might be hard to film.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",
  "I have a living will and I have friends, and I have money and I have hope.\n -- Terry Pratchett\n",

  "The main problem with writing in verse is, if your fourth line doesn't come out right, you've got to throw four lines away and figure out a whole new way to attack the problem. So the mortality rate is terrific.\n -- Dr. Seuss\n",
  "You're in pretty good shape for the shape you are in.\n -- Dr. Seuss\n",

  "'The Lorax' book was intended to be propaganda.\n -- Dr. Seuss\n",
  "The problem with writing a book in verse is, to be successful, it has to sound like you knocked it off on a rainy Friday afternoon. It has to sound easy. When you can do it, it helps tremendously because it's a thing that forces kids to read on. You have this unconsummated feeling if you stop.\n -- Dr. Seuss\n",
  "Preachers in pulpits talked about what a great message is in the book. No matter what you do, somebody always imputes meaning into your books.\n -- Dr. Seuss\n",

  "Sometimes, when I see my granddaughters make small discoveries of their own, I wish I were a child.\n -- Dr. Seuss\n",

  "I have not worked out my poems with a careful will, falling rather on haphazard and blind formulation of wordage, a more flowing concept, in a hope for a more new and lively path. I do personalize at times, but this only for the grace and elan of the dance.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "Having a bunch of cats around is good. If you're feeling bad, you just look at the cats, you'll feel better because they know that everything is just as it is. There's nothing to get excited about. They just know. They're saviours.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "When I write, when I'm going hot, I don't want to write more than four hours in a row. After that, you're pushing it.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",

  "I am a dangerous man when turned loose with a typewriter.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "Most poets are young simply because they have not been caught up. Show me an old poet, and I'll show you, more often than not, either a madman or a master... it's when you begin to lie to yourself in a poem in order simply to make a poem that you fail. That is why I do not rework poems.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "When I say that basically writing is a hard hustle, I don't mean that it is a bad life, if one can get away with it. It's the miracle of miracles to make a living by the typer.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "When I worked on a magazine, I learned that there are many, many writers writing that can't write at all; and they keep on writing all the cliches and bromides and 1890 plots, and poems about Spring and poems about Love, and poems they think are modern because they are done in slang or staccato style, or written with all the 'i's' small.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "Early on, when I was quite young and going from job to job, I was foolish enough to sometimes speak to my fellow workers: 'Hey, the boss can come in here at any moment and lay all of us off, just like that, don't you realize that?' They would just look at me. I was posing something that they didn't want to enter their minds.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "To not to have entirely wasted one's life seems to be a worthy accomplishment, if only for myself.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",

  "Writers have to put up with this editor thing; it is ageless and eternal and wrong.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "When everything works best, it's not because you chose writing but because writing chose you. It's when you're mad with it, it's when it's stuffed in your ears, your nostrils, under your fingernails. It's when there's no hope but that.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",

  "I don't write so much now. I'm getting on 33, pot belly and creeping dementia.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "The more cats you have, the longer you live. If you have a hundred cats, you'll live 10 times longer than if you have 10. Someday this will be discovered, and people will have a thousand cats and live forever. It's truly ridiculous.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "My love is a hummingbird sitting that quiet moment on the bough, as the same cat crouches.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",

  "I only type every third night. I have no plan. My mind is a blank. I sit down. The typewriter gives me things I don't even know I'm working on. It's a free lunch. A free dinner.

  "Those who have been writing literature have not been writing life.\n -- Charles Bukowski\n",
  "I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I wish being a beekeeper, which I am, gave you a free pass on the carbon footprint, but it doesn't.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I've known ambitious people with no aptitude for the thing they did. Most of whom, rather terrifyingly, tended to succeed.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Great, big, serious novels always get awards. If it's a battle between a great, big, serious novel and a funny novel, the funny novel is doomed.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Is the chemical aftertaste the reason why people eat hot dogs, or is it some kind of bonus?\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Like some kind of particularly tenacious vampire the short story refuses to die, and seems at this point in time to be a wonderful length for our generation.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Short stories are tiny windows into other worlds and other minds and dreams. They are journeys you can make to the far side of the universe and still be back in time for dinner.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "What I'd love to do is every now and then go, 'Oh my God, I've got this amazing idea for 'Doctor Who.'\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "My theory on genre is that while there are people out there who believe that genre tells people what to read, actually I believe that genre exists as a marketing tool to tell you what to avoid.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Things need not have happened to be true. Tales and adventures are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgotten.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "It has always been the prerogative of children and half-wits to point out that the emperor has no clothes. But the half-wit remains a half-wit, and the emperor remains an emperor.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Empathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I've never known anyone who was what he or she seemed; or at least, was only what he or she seemed. People carry worlds within them.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",

  "A nice, easy place for freedom of speech to be eroded is comics, because comics are a natural target whenever an election comes up.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",

  "And there never was an apple, in Adam's opinion, that wasn't worth the trouble you got into for eating it.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "When I was a kid, we actually lived in a house that had been divided in two at one point, which meant that one room in our house opened up onto a brick wall. And I was convinced all I had to do was just open it the right way and it wouldn't be a brick wall. So I'd sidle over to the door and I'd pull it open.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "When I started out, there were a lot of things I knew I couldn't do, and a lot of things I only found out I couldn't do by going and doing it. And no-one was watching, and nobody cared.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The great thing about Batman and Superman, in truth, is that they are literally transcendent. They are better than most of the stories they are in.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "As a kid, I would get my parents to drop me off at my local library on their way to work during the summer holidays, and I would walk home at night. For several years, I read the children's library until I finished the children's library. Then I moved into the adult library and slowly worked my way through them.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Life is always going to be stranger than fiction, because fiction has to be convincing, and life doesn't.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The short story is still like the novel's wayward younger brother, we know that it's not respectable - but I think that can also add to the glory of it.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Write your story as it needs to be written. Write it honestly, and tell it as best you can. I'm not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",

  "I don't know if proud is the right word, but I am somebody who does not, on the whole, have the highest regard for my own stuff in that when I look all I get to see are the flaws.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I'll agonize over sentences. Mostly because you're trying to create specific effects with sentences, and because there are a number of different voices in the book.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "So I went out and bought myself a copy of the Writer and Artist Yearbook, bought lots of magazines and got on the phone and talked to editors about ideas for stories. Pretty soon I found myself hired to do interviews and articles and went off and did them.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I lost some time once. It's always in the last place you look for it.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Make good art.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "It is a fool's prerogative to utter truths that no one else will speak.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Also, I've already won all the awards.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Life - and I don't suppose I'm the first to make this comparison - is a disease: sexually transmitted, and invariably fatal.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The world always seems brighter when you've just made something that wasn't there before.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",

  "The biggest difference between England and America is that England has history, while America has geography.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "When you're starting off as a young writer, you look at all the stuff that's gone before and the stuff that's influenced you, and you reach the ladle of your imagination into this bubbling stew pot of all of this stuff, and you pour it out. And that's where you start from.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "So the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund is out there preserving and fighting for, and sometimes winning and sometimes losing, the fight for First Amendment rights in comics and, more generally, for freedom of speech.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The current total of countries in the world with First Amendments is one. You have guaranteed freedom of speech. Other countries don't have that.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "It's not a bad thing for a writer not to feel at home. Writers - we're much more comfortable at parties standing in the corner watching everybody else having a good time than we are mingling.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The moment that you feel that just possibly you are walking down the street naked... that's the moment you may be starting to get it right.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "A good writer should be able to write comedic work that made you laugh, and scary stuff that made you scared, and fantasy or science fiction that imbued you with a sense of wonder, and mainstream journalism that gave you clear and concise information in a way that you wanted it.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I believe that stories are incredibly important, possibly in ways we don't understand, in allowing us to make sense of our lives, in allowing us to escape our lives, in giving us empathy and in creating the world that we live in.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "My guiltiest pleasure is Harry Stephen Keeler. He may have been the greatest bad writer America has ever produced. Or perhaps the worst great writer. I do not know. There are few faults you can accuse him of that he is not guilty of. But I love him.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "It's a given that we exist in a world where we have to live in continuity every day; no one is immune to that, in life or romance novels. By the same token, it's not something I find terribly important.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Every now and then I'll do little things, a short story or something, that doesn't have any fantastical elements, but mostly I like the power of playing God and I like to imagine things.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I kept starting 'Anansi Boys' as a movie and stopping, and eventually wrote the novel and was happy.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "When I was young, I was reading anything and anything I could lay my hands on. I was a veracious-to-the-point-of-insane reader.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "We all not only could know everything. We do. We just tell ourselves we don't to make it all bearable.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "As far as I'm concerned, the entire reason for becoming a writer is not having to get up in the morning.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Because, if one is writing novels today, concentrating on the beauty of the prose is right up there with concentrating on your semi-colons, for wasted effort.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I'm one of those writers who tends to be really good at making outlines and sticking to them. I'm very good at doing that, but I don't like it. It sort of takes a lot of the fun out.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "There's a glorious sense of freedom in comedy, just allowing myself to tell jokes, allowing myself to interrupt myself and tell old African folk stories that I made up - or didn't - and Jamaican stories.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I was one those kids who had books on them. Before weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, funerals and anything else where you're actually meant to not be reading, my family would frisk me and take the book away. If they didn't find it by this point in the procedure, I would be sitting over in that corner completely unnoticed just reading my book.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "You can take for granted that people know more or less what a street, a shop, a beach, a sky, an oak tree look like. Tell them what makes this one different.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "In the case of 'Ocean at the End of the Lane,' it's a book about helplessness. It's a book about family, it's a book about being 7 in a world of people who are bigger than you, and more dangerous, and stepping into territory that you don't entirely understand.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I don't think I'm mainstream. I think what I am is lots and lots of different cults. And when you get lots and lots of small groups who like you a lot, they add up to a big group without ever actually becoming mainstream.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "As a teenager I wrote to R.A. Lafferty. And he responded, too, with letters that were like R.A. Lafferty short stories, filled with elliptical answers to straight questions and simple answers to complicated ones.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "'Doctor Who' was the first mythology that I learned, before ever I ran into Greek or Roman or Egyptian mythologies.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I had started to feel that somewhere in the second half of the 20th century, the idea of page-turning as a good thing had been lost. You were getting books that were the equivalent of absolutely beautifully prepared dishes of food that didn't taste like anything much.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Continuity isn't actually something that I ever worry about. You use it where you need to, and you don't use it where you don't need to.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "'American Gods' was designed to be, if not open-ended, at least a trilogy kind of shape, so there's definitely one more book, probably another couple of books there to get written.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "As an author, I've never forgotten how to daydream.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I suspect there are two kinds of novelists. Those who have a point of view and have something to say and then write a novel in order to say that thing, and those of us who write the book in order to find out what we think about that thing.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Going off the grid is always good for me. It's the way that I've started books and finished books and gotten myself out of deadline dooms and things.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I loved writing a book in which, in some ways, it's very, very classical, and in some ways I'm breaking lots of rules about what you can do and what you can't do.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The simplest way to make sure that we raise literate children is to teach them to read, and to show them that reading is a pleasurable activity.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I don't think there is such a thing as a bad book for children.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The joy of doing 'Sandman' was doing a comic and telling people, 'No, it has an end,' at a time when nobody thought you could actually get to the end and stop doing a comic that people were still buying just because you'd finished.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "My stuff gets published in some countries as fiction and in some countries as fantasy. It's just where they think it will do best in the bookshops.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I like reading. I prefer not reading on my computer, because that makes whatever I am reading feel like work. I do not mind reading on my iPad.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "You know, it's weird being interviewed! Because the weird thing about being interviewed is you get asked these questions that you've never thought about, and you find out what you think as you answer.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I'm never, I hope, stupid enough to believe that Twitter or blogging or any of this stuff is a substitute for actually doing the work or writing a book.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Anything that keeps you happy and writing is part of my writing ritual: I like music, so I tend to have it playing in the background. But if I'm interested, I can write in an airport waiting areas.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "I want to write a play. I'd like to do an original musical. I should probably put together a poetry collection.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "For me, the glory of my first 25 years as a writer was I could put things off as long as I wanted.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Partly because I get such astonishingly nice fans.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "American Gods is about 200,000 words long, and I'm sure there are words that are simply in there 'cause I like them. I know I couldn't justify each and every one of them.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "In many ways, it was much, much harder to get the first book contract. The hardest thing probably overall has been learning not to trust people, publicists and so forth, implicitly.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "It's a wonderful thing, as a writer, to be given parameters and walls and barriers.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "Oh, tweeting prolifically is the most easy thing in the world. Tweeting prolifically is like somebody saying, 'Boy, you're a really good walker around,' you know. It's not really hard.\n -- Neil Gaiman\n",
  "The best thing about getting a flu shot is that you never again need to wash your hands. That's how I see it.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",

  "If you start in the pit of despair with these profane, awful things, even a glimmer of hope or awareness is going to occur that's much brighter coming from this dark, awful beginning.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "Some of the best ideas I get seem to happen when I'm doing mindless manual labor or exercise. I'm not sure how that happens, but it leaves me free for remarkable ideas to occur.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "Nobody's told me anything to date that I've been completely reviled by.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "I would say any behavior that is not the status quo is interpreted as insanity, when, in fact, it might actually be enlightenment. Insanity is sorta in the eye of the beholder.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "Crap has always happened, crap is happening, and crap will continue to happen.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "The unreal is more powerful than the real, because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it, because it's only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles, wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "For me and my entire generation, we took on this kind of sarcastic, ironic, snarkiness because it seemed the most extreme reaction to the earnestness of hippies.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "While writing, I tend to repeat the same song, endlessly, for thousands of times. This helps me ignore any lyrics, and helps create a consistent mood for each book.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "People used what they called a telephone because they hated being close together and they were scared of being alone.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "Sometimes you do something, and you get screwed. Sometimes it's the things you don't do, and you get screwed.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",

  "I'm trying to make order out of chaos, trying to find some way of rationalising the horrific things that people do or the way the world is.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "We're making the same mistakes we made 1,000 years ago. So they must be the right ones. So relax.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "To merely observe your culture without contributing to it seems very close to existing as a ghost.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "Men are destroyed for being rebellious, and women destroy themselves by failing to be rebellious. Unless you can make that next jump to either getting along with people or resisting people, you are ultimately destroying yourself.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "A minute of perfection was worth the effort. A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",

  "Game shows are designed to make us feel better about the random, useless facts that are all we have left of our education.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "Do you remember when you were 10 or 11 years old and you really thought your folks were the best? They were completely omniscient and you took their word for everything. And then you got older and you went through this hideous age when suddenly they were the devil, they were bullies, and they didn't know anything.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "Personal identity seems like it's just such an American archetype, from Holly Golightly re-inventing herself in 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' to Jay Gatsby in 'The Great Gatsby.' It seems like the sort of archetypal American issue. If you're given the freedom to be anything, or be anyone, what do you do with it?\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "I've always thought stand-up comedians were the oral storytellers of our time, because they know rhetoric, they know delivery, they know timing, they know all of these things that you can only learn by telling a story out loud and interacting with an audience.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",

  "I believe in something. But I don't believe that anything can hold a grudge for long enough to condemn its creation to eternal punishment. Nobody can hold a grudge that long, even God.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "We don't see a lot of models for male social interaction. There's sports and barn raisings.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "If you flee from the things you fear, there's no resolution.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
  "As a lower-class kid, I was raised to think success would be owning stuff. Having that great job, too. Now I find my parents' dream was wrong. You never really own anything. And you're never really finished as a person.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",

  "In books, you can just wallow in dialogue, and you can just wallow in written words. In screenplays, every line has to serve the purpose of the line that's implied before it and the line that's implied after it. Maybe five lines have to do the work of fifty lines.\n -- Chuck Palahniuk\n",
