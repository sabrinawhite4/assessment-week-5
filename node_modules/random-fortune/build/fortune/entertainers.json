  "I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: 'try being rich first'. See if that doesn't cover most of it. There's not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job.\n -- Bill Murray\n",
  "While I have felt lonely many times in my life, the oddest feeling of all was after my mother, Lucille, died. My father had already died, but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely, yet I did.\n -- Bill Murray\n",
  "There's only a couple times when fame is ever helpful. Sometimes you can get into a restaurant where the kitchen is just closing. Sometimes you can avoid a traffic violation. But the only time it really matters is in the emergency room with your kids. That's when you want to be noticed, because it's very easy to get forgotten in an ER.\n -- Bill Murray\n",

  "The studios don't seem to foster good writing. They're not so interested in that, but they're more interested in what worked most recently. They're definitely very serious about making money, and that's not a wrong thing, but you don't have to make money the same way all the time.\n -- Bill Murray\n",
  "I'm a nut, but not just a nut.\n -- Bill Murray\n",

  "I think all phases of one's career are serious if you take it seriously no matter if you are doing high profile dramatic pieces or not.\n -- Bill Murray\n",
  "I think that the online world has actually brought books back. People are reading because they're reading the damn screen. That's more reading than people used to do.\n -- Bill Murray\n",
  "This really should be kept secret, but you can learn a lot by watching the making-of DVDs. Every actor should do it. You figure out what you're dealing with.\n -- Bill Murray\n",

  "Whenever I think of the high salaries we are paid as film actors, I think it is for the travel, the time away, and any trouble you get into through being well known. It's not for the acting, that's for sure.\n -- Bill Murray\n",
  "But I can only take so much TV, because there is so much advice. I find people will preach about virtually anything - your diet, how to live your life, how to improve your golf. The lot. I have always had a thing against the Mister Know-It-Alls.\n -- Bill Murray\n",
