  "Since the Church is to be servant to the poor, it is our fault if that wealth is not channeled to help the poor in our world.\n  --  Cesar Chavez\n",
  "Though many of the poor have come to see the affluent middle class as its enemy, that class actually stands between the poor and the real powers in this society - the administrative octopus with its head in Washington, the conglomerates, the military complex.\n  --  Cesar Chavez\n",
  "The burdens of generations of poverty and powerlessness lie heavy in the fields of America. If we fail, there are those who will see violence as the shortcut to change.\n  --  Cesar Chavez\n",
  "As long as we have a poor country bordering California, it's going to be very difficult to win strikes.\n  --  Cesar Chavez\n",
  "Farm workers are society's canaries. Farm workers - and their children - demonstrate the effects of pesticide poisoning before anyone else.\n  --  Cesar Chavez\n",
  "They won't break me because the desire for freedom, and the freedom of the Irish people, is in my heart. The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show. It is then that we will see the rising of the moon.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "I am a political prisoner. I am a political prisoner because I am a casualty of a perennial war that is being fought between the oppressed Irish people and an alien, oppressive, unwanted regime that refuses to withdraw from our land.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "I am (even after all the torture) amazed at British logic. Never in eight centuries have they succeeded in breaking the spirit of one man who refused to be broken. They have not dispirited, conquered, nor demoralised my people, nor will they ever.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "They have nothing in their whole imperial arsenal that can break the spirit of one Irishman who doesn't want to be broken.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "Our revenge will be the laughter of our children.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "Everyone, Republican or otherwise has their own particular part to play. No part is too great or too small, no one is too old or too young to do something.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "They won't break me because the desire for freedom, and the freedom of the Irish people, is in my heart.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "I was a skeleton compared to what I used to be, but it didn't matter. Nothing really mattered except remaining unbroken.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "We wish to be treated 'not as ordinary prisoners,' for we are not criminals. We admit no crime - unless, that is, the love of one's people and country is a crime.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "I was only a working-class boy from a Nationalist ghetto. But it is repression that creates the revolutionary spirit of freedom.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show. It is then we'll see the rising of the moon.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "If a British government experienced such a long and persistent resistance to domestic policy in England, then that policy would almost certainly be changed... We have asserted that we are political prisoners, and everything about out country - our arrests, interrogations, trials, and prison conditions - show that we are politically motivated.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "We must see our present fight right through to the very end.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "Well, I have gotten by twenty-seven years, so that is something. I may die, but the Republic of 1916 will never die. Onward to the Republic and liberation of our people.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "The body doesn't accept the lack of food, and it suffers from the temptation of food and from other aspects which gnaw at it perpetually. The body fights back sure enough, but at the end of the day, everything returns to the primary consideration - that is, the mind.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "They have nothing in their entire arsenal to break the spirit of one single Republican prisoner-of-war who refuses to be broken,' I thought, and that was very true. They cannot or never will break our spirit.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "I was set to confront the might of the imperial empire with an M-1 carbine and enough hate to topple the world.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "I am dying not just to attempt to end the barbarity of H-blocks or to gain the rightful recognition of political prisoners, but primarily because what is lost here is lost for the Republic.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "There is that much to be done that no select or small portion of people can do; only the greater mass of the Irish nation will ensure the achievement of a Socialist Republic, and this can only be done by hard work and sacrifice.\n  --  Bobby Sands\n",
  "A virtuous character is likened to an unblemished flower. Piety is a fadeless bud that half opens on earth and expands through eternity. Sweetness of temper is the odor of fresh blooms, and the amaranth flowers of pure affection open but to bloom forever.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "The rose is the flower and handmaiden of love - the lily, her fair associate, is the emblem of beauty and purity.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "The fact is that, in all prisons everywhere, cruelties on the one hand and injudicious laxity of discipline on the other have at times appeared and will, at intervals, be renewed except the most vigilant oversight is maintained.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "I have had so much at heart. Defeated, not conquered; disappointed, not discouraged. I have but to be more energetic and more faithful in the difficult and painful vocation to which my life is devoted.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "The duties of a teacher are neither few nor small, but they elevate the mind and give energy to the character.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "They say, 'Nothing can be done here!' I reply, 'I know no such word in the vocabulary I adopt!'\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Jasmine, the name of which signifies fragrance, is the emblem of delicacy and elegance. It is reared with difficulty in New England, but at the South, puts forth all its graces.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Your minds may now be likened to a garden, which will, if neglected, yield only weeds and thistles; but, if cultivated, will produce the most beautiful flowers, and the most delicious fruits.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "With care and patience, people may accomplish things which, to an indolent person, would appear impossible.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Steady, firm, and kind government of prisoners is the truest humanity and the best exercise of duty. It is with convicts as with children: unseasonable indulgence, indiscreetly granted, leads to mischiefs which we may deplore but cannot repair.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "I may be too craving of that rich gift, the power of sharing other minds. I have drunk deeply, long, and oh! how blissfully at this fountain in a foreign clime. Hearts met hearts, minds joined with minds; and what were the secondary trials of pain to the enfeebled, suffering body when daily was administered the soul's medicine and food!\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Men need knowledge in order to overpower their passions and master their prejudices.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "The olive branch has been consecrated to peace, palm branches to victory, the laurel to conquest and poetry, the myrtle to love and pleasure, the cypress to mourning, and the willow to despondency.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "I worship talents almost. I sinfully dare mourn that I possess them not.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",

  "Pleasures take to themselves wings and fly away; true knowledge remains forever.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "I believe the best mode of aiding convicts is so to apportion their tasks in prison as to give to the industrious the opportunity of earning a sum for themselves by 'over-work.' A man usually values that most for which he has labored; he uses that most frugally which he has toiled hour by hour and day by day to acquire.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "We are not sent into this world mainly to enjoy the loveliness therein, nor to sit us down in passive ease; no, we were sent here for action. The soul that seeks to do the will of God with a pure heart, fervently, does not yield to the lethargy of ease.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Always remember those things that tend to strengthen and improve your understanding. You cannot learn without attention, neither retain those lessons that you have once learnt without frequently reflecting upon and reviewing them in your mind; by this means, things long past will remain impressed upon your memory.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "What child has ever known the country and has not twined hundreds of fragrant wreaths with the yellow shining cowslip and the more frail and delicate violet - mingling here and there green leaves culled from the odorous eglantine, or, as we more commonly call it, sweetbriar.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Those who do wrong very often think others are censuring them, when they are not even thought of.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",

  "My wish is to be known only thru my work.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Man is not made better by being degraded; he is seldom restrained from crime by harsh measures, except the principle of fear predominates in his character, and then he is never made radically better for its influence.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Rules must be established and enforced, and, as numbers are increased in prisons, the necessity for vigilance increases. These rules, let it be understood, may be kindly while firmly enforced. I would never suffer any exhibition of ill-temper or an arbitrary exercise of authority.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Why not, when it can be done without exposure or expense, let me rescue some of America's miserable children from vice and guilt?\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "The great benefactors of individuals and of communities are the enlightened educators: the wise-teaching, mental and moral instructors and exemplars of our times.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",

  "In order to do good, a man must be good; and he will not be good except he have instruction by counsel and by example.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",

  "The lovely daisy, so justly celebrated by European poets, is not a native of our soil; we know it well, however, by cultivation in our gardens and green houses; besides, we are disposed to remember it for the sake of those who have sung its praises in immortal verse.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Of my English friends, I should find language too poor to speak the just praise and the excellence which shines in their characters and lives.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",

  "By all means, have you give great attention to your arithmetic, as its advantages are so many and important.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "I shall be well enough when I get to Kentucky or Alabama. The tonic I need is the tonic of opposition. That always sets me on my feet.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Society during the last hundred years has been alternately perplexed and encouraged respecting the two great questions: how shall the criminal and pauper be disposed of in order to reduce crime and reform the criminal on the one hand and, on the other, to diminish pauperism and restore the pauper to useful citizenship?\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Know,' says a wise writer, the historian of kings, 'Know the men that are to be trusted'; but how is this to be? The possession of knowledge involves both time and opportunities. Neither of these are 'handservants at command.'\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "That statesman is indeed happy who can count as his friends the really honest and consistent, the true Patriots, and the men of honorable thought.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "There is, I think, great difficulty in writing of one's self: it is almost impossible to present subjects where the chief actor must be conspicuous and not seem to be, or really be, egotistical.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "I must study alone, as I am condemned to do every thing alone, I believe, in this life.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",

  "To me, the avocation of a teacher has something elevating and exciting. While surrounded by the young, one may always be doing good.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Nothing seems to me so likely to make people unhappy in themselves and at variance with others as the habit of killing time.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "As you have learnt something of time, value and make a proper use of it. Once past, it knows no return; how necessary, then, that you spend it in improving your mind and fitting it for future happiness and usefulness.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Think how slow would be your progress in learning without printed books: you could study only manuscripts, and those necessarily must be very few in number. Learn from this to value your books, and always handle them with care.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "It is of no use to commit whole pages to memory, merely to recite them once without hesitation; you must think of the meaning more than the words - of the ideas more than the language.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Time passed solely in the pursuit of pleasure leaves no solid enjoyment for the future; but from the hours you spend in reading and studying useful books, you will gather a golden harvest in future years.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "If we had only those things which are procured with ease and freedom from danger, we should find the comforts and luxuries, if not many of the necessaries of life, considerably diminished.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Attention to any subject will in a short time render it attractive, be it ever so disagreeable and tedious at first.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",

  "The capsules of the geranium furnish admirable barometers. Fasten the beard, when fully ripe, upon a stand, and it will twist itself or untwist, according as the air is moist or dry.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "The fabled origin of the laurel is this. Daphne, daughter of the river Peneus, offended by the persecutions of Apollo, implored succour of the gods, who changed her into a laurel tree. Apollo crowned his head with the leaves and ordered that forever after, the tree should be sacred to him.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "There is, in our nature, a disposition to indulgence, a secret desire to escape from labor, which, unless hourly combated, will overcome and destroy the best faculties of our minds and paralyze our most useful powers.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "I am contracting continually a debt of gratitude which time will never see canceled. There is a treasury from which it will be repaid, but I do not dispense its stores.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "All my habits through life have been singularly removed from any condition of reliance on others, and the feeling - right or wrong - that aloneness is my proper position has prevailed since my early childhood, no doubt nourished and strengthened by many and quick-following bereavements.\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Life is not to be expended in vain regrets. No day, no hour, comes but brings in its train work to be performed for some useful end - the suffering to be comforted, the wandering led home, the sinner reclaimed. Oh! How can any fold the hands to rest and say to the spirit, 'Take thine ease, for all is well!'\n  --  Dorothea Dix\n",
  "Our country's national crime is lynching. It is not the creature of an hour, the sudden outburst of uncontrolled fury, or the unspeakable brutality of an insane mob.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "The people must know before they can act, and there is no educator to compare with the press.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "Brave men do not gather by thousands to torture and murder a single individual, so gagged and bound he cannot make even feeble resistance or defense.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",

  "Although lynchings have steadily increased in number and barbarity during the last twenty years, there has been no single effort put forth by the many moral and philanthropic forces of the country to put a stop to this wholesale slaughter.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "The mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the Afro-American.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "What becomes a crime deserving capital punishment when the tables are turned is a matter of small moment when the negro woman is the accusing party.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",

  "The only times an Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and used it in self-defense.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "The nineteenth century lynching mob cuts off ears, toes, and fingers, strips off flesh, and distributes portions of the body as souvenirs among the crowd.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "I came home every Friday afternoon, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. I spent Saturday and Sunday washing and ironing and cooking for the children and went back to my country school on Sunday afternoon.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "In fact, for all kinds of offenses - and, for no offenses - from murders to misdemeanors, men and women are put to death without judge or jury; so that, although the political excuse was no longer necessary, the wholesale murder of human beings went on just the same.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",

  "The Afro-American is not a bestial race.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "The Afro-American is thus the backbone of the South.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "I had an instinctive feeling that the people who have little or no school training should have something coming into their homes weekly which dealt with their problems in a simple, helpful way... so I wrote in a plain, common-sense way on the things that concerned our people.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "The alleged menace of universal suffrage having been avoided by the absolute suppression of the negro vote, the spirit of mob murder should have been satisfied and the butchery of negroes should have ceased.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "The South resented giving the Afro-American his freedom, the ballot box and the Civil Rights Law.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",
  "Thus lynch law held sway in the far West until civilization spread into the Territories and the orderly processes of law took its place. The emergency no longer existing, lynching gradually disappeared from the West.\n  --  Ida B. Wells\n",

  "Learning, while at school, that the charge for the education of girls was the same as that for boys, and that, when they became teachers, women received only half as much as men for their services, the injustice of this distinction was so apparent.\n  --  Lucretia Mott\n",
  "Those who read the Scriptures and judge for themselves, not resting satisfied with the perverted application of the text, do not find the distinction that theology and ecclesiastical authorities have made in the condition of the sexes.\n  --  Lucretia Mott\n",

  "My address is like my shoes. It travels with me. I abide where there is a fight against wrong.\n  --  Mother Jones\n",

  "All my time not devoted to my master's service was spent either in prayer, or in making experiments in casting different things in moulds made of earth, in attempting to make paper, gunpowder, and many other experiments, that, although I could not perfect, yet convinced me of its practicability if I had the means.\n  --  Nat Turner\n",

  "To a mind like mine, restless, inquisitive, and observant of everything that was passing, it is easy to suppose that religion was the subject to which it would be directed; and, although this subject principally occupied my thoughts, there was nothing that I saw or heard of to which my attention was not directed.\n  --  Nat Turner\n",
  "When I got large enough to go to work, while employed I was reflecting on many things that would present themselves to my imagination; and whenever an opportunity occurred of looking at a book, when the school-children were getting their lessons, I would find many things that the fertility of my own imagination had depicted to me before.\n  --  Nat Turner\n",

  "The masses are in reality their own leaders, dialectically creating their own development process.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",

  "Our scribblings are usually not lyrics but whirrings, without colour or resonance, like the tone of an engine-wheel.

  "Marxism is a revolutionary worldview that must always struggle for new revelations.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",
  "Social democracy seeks and finds the ways, and particular slogans, of the workers' struggle only in the course of the development of this struggle, and gains directions for the way forward through this struggle alone.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",

Russian society, equally discouraged by the collapse of all hopes for peaceful reforms and by the apparent ineffectiveness of the revolutionary movement, was in the grip of a mood of depression and resignation.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",
  "Credit reproduces all the fundamental antagonisms of the capitalist world. It accentuates them. It precipitates their development and thus pushes the capitalist world forward to its own destruction.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",
  "Social democracy... is only the advance guard of the proletariat, a small piece of the total working masses; blood from their blood, and flesh from their flesh.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",
  "The existing legal constitution is nothing but the product of a revolution. Revolution is the act of political creation in the history of classes, while constitutional legislation is the expression of the continual political vegetation of a society.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",
  "The very action of the proletariat is a determining factor in history. And although we can no more jump over the stages of historical development than a man can jump over his shadow, nevertheless, we can accelerate or retard that development.\n  --  Rosa Luxemburg\n",
