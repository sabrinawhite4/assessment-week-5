  "Blissful quiet, the rocking of a recent love\nIs both repose and anguish in my fainting dreams\n\n~ Racter (The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed)\n",
  "A hot and torrid bloom\nWhich fans wise flames\nAnd begs to be redeemed by forces black and strong\nWill now oppose my naked will\nAnd force me into regions of despair\n\n~ Racter (The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed)\n",
  "More than iron\nMore than lead\nMore than gold I need electricity\nI need it more than I need lamb or pork or lettuce or cucumber\nI need it for my dreams\n\n~ Racter (The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed)\n",
  "Blue potatoes are ungainly things\nAs are red and purple lamb chops\nYet when we eat and creep and fall\nWe never ask a silent question\n\n~ Racter (The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed)\n",
  "An eagle flies high, it flies higher than a sea gull\nBut the crow wings rapidly from tree to bush to hedge\nThe same can be true of life and of death\nSometimes life flies high, sometimes death wings rapidly\nSometimes it is spoken\nThat death wings from tree to bush to hedge\nSometimes it does not\n\n~ Racter (The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed)\n",
