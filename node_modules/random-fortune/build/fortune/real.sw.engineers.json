  "REAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERS DON'T READ DUMPS\n",
  "Real software engineers don't read dumps. They never generate them, and on\nthe rare occasions that they come across them, they are vaguely amused.\n",
  "Real software engineers don't comment their code. The identifiers are so\nmnemonic they don't have to.\n",
  "Real software engineers don't write applications programs, they implement\nalgorithms. If someone has an application that the algorithm might help\nwith, that's nice. Don't ask them to write the user interface, though.\n",
  "Real software engineers eat quiche.\n",
  "lf it doesn't have recursive function calls, real software engineers don't\nprogram in it. Real software engineers don't program in assembler. They\nbecome queasy at the very thought.\n",
  "Real software engineers don't debug programs, they verify correctness.\nThis process doesn't necessarily involve executing anything on a computer,\nexcept perhaps a Correctness Verification Aid package.\n",
  "Real software engineers like C's structured constructs, but they are\nsuspicious of it because they have heard that it lets you get ``close to\nthe machine.''\n",
  "Real software engineers play tennis. In general, they don't like any sport\nthat involves getting hot and sweaty and gross when out of range of a\nshower. (Thus mountain climbing is Right Out.) They will occasionally wear\ntheir tennis togs to work, but only on very sunny days.\n",
  "Real software engineers admire PASCAL for its discipline and Spartan\npurity, but they find it difficult to actually program in. They don't tell\nthis to their friends, because they are afraid it means that they are\nsomehow Unworthy.\n",
  "Real software engineers work from 9 to 5, because that is the way the job\nis described in the formal spec. Working late would feel like using an\nundocumented external procedure.\n",
  "Real software engineers write in languages that have not actually been\nimplemented for any machine, and for which only the formal spec (in BNF)\nis available. This keeps them from having to take any machine dependencies\ninto account. Machine dependencies make real software engineers very\nuneasy.\n",
  "Real software engineers don't write in ADA, because the standards bodies\nhave not quite decided on a formal spec yet.\n",
  "Real software engineers like writing their own compilers, preferably in\nPROLOG (they also like writing them in unimplemented languages, but it\nturns out to be difficult to actually RUN these).\n",
  "Real software engineers regret the existence of COBOL, FORTRAN and BASIC.\nPinl is getting there, but it is not nearly disciplined enough; far too\nmuch built in function.\n",
  "Real software engineers aren't too happy about the existence of users,\neither. Users always seem to have the wrong idea about what the\nimplementation and verification of algorithms is all about.\n",
  "Real software engineers don't like the idea of some inexplicable and\ngreasy hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any moment.\nThey have a great distrust of hardware people, and wish that systems could\nbe virtual at ALL levels. They would like personal computers (you know no\none's going to trip over something and kill your DFA in mid-transit),\nexcept that they need 8 megabytes to run their Correctness Verification\nAid packages.\n",
  "Real software engineers think better while playing WFF `N' PROOF.\n",
